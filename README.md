## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 
This model was created on Jetson Nano and trained on a dataset of electrolytic capacitors, integrated circuits, leds, potentiometers, resistors, semiconductor diodes, and transistors. It uses an imagenet.py program to classify each component


## Running this project

1. Have the Jetson Inference library and python3 both installed on your Jetson Nano.
2. Make sure to include any required libraries that need to be installed for your project to run.
3.
